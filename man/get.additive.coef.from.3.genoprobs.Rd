@description \code{get.add.coef.from.3.genoprobs} should not typically be called by a user.
   It is used to reliably set up model coefficients from genotype probabilities.

@param paa A vector of length n giving the probability of AA-type for each individual,
   or a matrix or data.frame of dimension n-by-3 giving probability of AA-type and
   the probability of AB-type and the probability of BB-type for each individual.
 @param pab A vector of length n giving the probability of AB-type for each individual,
   or missing if \code{pa} is a data.frame or matrix.
 @param pbb A vector of length n giving the probability of BB-type for each individual,
   or missing if \code{pa} is a data.frame or matrix.

@return Additive coefficient vector.
