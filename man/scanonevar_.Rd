\usage{
scanonevar_(modeling.df, genoprob.df, loc.info.df, scan.types, scan.formulae,
  return.covar.effects)

initialize.scanonevar.result_(loc.info.df, scan.types, scan.formulae,

  model.formulae)

LOD(alt, null)
}
\arguments{
\item{modeling.df}{the tbl_df that contains the response, all covariates,
and NA columns appropriate for marker effects}

\item{genoprob.df}{the tbl_df that contains the probability of each genotype
for each individual at each loc, where a 'loc' is either a marker or a pseudomarker}

\item{loc.info.df}{the tbl_df that contains information about the
locs that are being scanned, minimally a 'loc.name', 'chr' (short for
'chromosome') and 'pos' (short for 'position') for each loc.}

\item{scan.types}{Type(s) of scan(s) to be conducted, one of: 'mean',
'var', or c('mean', 'var', 'joint')}

\item{general.modeling.df}{The modeling df that will be used across the scan,
should have NA for all QTL columns.  These columns will be filled in in the result.}

\item{loc.genoprobs}{The genoprobs of all individuals of all allels at this loc.}

\item{model.formulae}{The formulae used for the scan.}

\item{genoprobs.long}{The genoprobs from which the additive genetic
component should be extracted.  The 'long' format implies that each row
has information on the genoprob of one individual having one allele.}

\item{alt}{alternative DGLM}

\item{null}{null DGLM}

\item{genoprobs.long}{The genoprobs from which the additive genetic
component should be extracted.  The 'long' format implies that each row
has information on the genoprob of one individual having one allele.}
}
\value{
a scanonevar object

A tbl_df with the metadata for a scanonevar, once filled in by
the scanonevar function, it will be a scanonevar object.

a modeling df appropriate for modeling at one specific loc

A vector of the additive genetic component at the locus

A vector of the dominance genetic component at the locus

log( likelihood of alternative model / likelihood of null model)
