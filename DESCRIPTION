Description: In recognition that there are many factors (genetic loci, macro-genetic factors such as sex,
  and environmental factors) that influence the environmental variation, the 'vqtl' package conducts genome
  scans that accomodate and target these factors.  The main functions of this pacakge, \code{scanonevar} and
  \code{scanonevar.perm} take as input a cross object from the popular \pkg{qtl} package.
Depends: R (>= 2.14.0), dglm, evd, dplyr
